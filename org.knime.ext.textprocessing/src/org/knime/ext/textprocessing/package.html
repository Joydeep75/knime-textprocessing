<body>
This package contains all classes making up the textprocessing plugin.
Be aware that this plugin has to be build as directory since some nodes
are based on the OpenNlp framework which needs i.e. for tokenization or POS 
tagging model files. These model files can only be loaded from a directory not
from a jar file.
