    <name>StanfordNLP Relation Extractor</name>
    <shortDescription>Extracts relation triplets from documents.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Extracts relations triplets contained in sentences of a document by investigating relations of tagged named-entities.
			The node needs part-of-speech and named-entity tagged documents. 
			Additionally, there has to be a second document column containing lemmatized documents.<br/>
			
			However, this node can also be used with plain documents by using the <i>Apply preprocessing</i> option.
			If this option is selected, part-of-speech tagging, named-entity tagging and lemmatizing will be done 
			by this node. The Stanford CoreNLP default settings are used in this case.<br/>
			
			<i>Note</i>: Relation Extraction is a computationally expensive operation. For the usage of this
            node it is recommended to run KNIME with at least 2GB of heap space. To increase the heap space, change
            the -Xmx setting in the knime.ini file.<br/>
            
            This node is based on Stanford CoreNLP 3.9.1.<br/>
