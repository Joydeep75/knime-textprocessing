    <name>StanfordNLP Relation Extractor</name>
    <shortDescription>Extracts relation triplets from documents.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Extracts relations triplets contained in sentences of a document by investigating relations of tagged named-entities.
			The node needs part-of-speech and named-entity tagged documents. 
			Additionally, there has to be a second document column containing lemmatized documents, meaning that all
			words are converted to their canonical form, dictionary form or citation form.<br/>
			
			However, this node can also be used with plain documents by using the <i>Apply preprocessing</i> option.
			If this option is selected, part-of-speech tagging, named-entity tagging and lemmatizing will be done 
			by this node. The Stanford CoreNLP default settings are used in this case. These task will be applied internally 
			and will not affect the documents in the document column. Extracting tags and lemmas produced by checking this option
			is not possible.<br/>
			
			The node creates four new columns: two object columns containing named-entities, a relation type column and 
			a confidence column. Currently, the node only handles classic named-entities like PERSON, LOCATION and
			ORGANIZATION.<br/>
			Relation types that can be extracted are <i>Live_In</i>, <i>OrgBased_In</i>, <i>Located_In</i>, <i>Work_For</i> 
			and <i>_NR</i> for no relation between two entities. <br/>
			The confidence refers to the relation type with the highest probability of these five classes.
			
			<i>Note</i>: Relation Extraction is a computationally expensive operation. For the usage of this
            node it is recommended to run KNIME with at least 2GB of heap space. To increase the heap space, change
            the -Xmx setting in the knime.ini file.<br/>
            
            This node is based on Stanford CoreNLP 3.9.1.<br/>
