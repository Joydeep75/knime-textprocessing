    <name>Term vector</name>
    <shortDescription>Creates a term vector for each term.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node creates a term vector for each term to
            represent the terms in the document space. The values of
            the feature vectors can be specified as boolean values or as 
            values of a specified column i.e. an tf*idf column. The dimension
            of the vectors will be equal to the number of distinct documents
            in the BoW. 
        </intro>
        
        <option name="Document column">
             The column containing the documents to use.
        </option>           
        <option name="Ignore tags">
             If checked tags are ignored when comparing terms.
        </option>
        <option name="Bitvector">
             If checked a bitvector will be created indicating whether a 
             certain document contains a term or not.
        </option>
        <option name="Vector value">
             If Bitvector setting is not checked it is possible to specify the
             column to use as feature vector values. The column can i.e. contain
             tf*idf values which are than used as values of the feature vector.
             Be aware that you have to compute these values before using this
             node. To do so i.e. the frequency calculation nodes can be used.
        </option>
        <option name="As collection cell">
             If checked all vector entries will be stored in a collection cell
             consisting of double cells. The cells are ordered, the ordering
             is specified in the data table spec. If not checked all double
             cells will be stored in corresponding columns. The advantage 
             of the column representation is that most of the regular algorithms
             in KNIME can be applied. The disadvantage is (which is on the 
             other hand the advantage of the collection representation) that
             processing of subsequent nodes will be slowed down, due to the many
             columns that will be created (dependent on the input data of 
             course).
