    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Apache Tika is a library that is mainly used to detect document types and extract textual contents and metadata from various file formats. Internally, Tika delegates all the parsing and detecting works to 
            various existing document parsers and document type detection libraries. Tika provides a single generic API as a universal type detector and content extractor for many file formats. For more information about Tika, please
            check the <a href="https://tika.apache.org/">Tika website</a>.<br/><br/>
            This node allows parsing of any kind of documents that are supported by Tika. The type of the files can be selected in the configuration dialog. Users have the choice between selecting the file extensions, or the
            MIME-types. What kind of information that are to be extracted from the file (metadata and content) can also be selected in the dialog.
