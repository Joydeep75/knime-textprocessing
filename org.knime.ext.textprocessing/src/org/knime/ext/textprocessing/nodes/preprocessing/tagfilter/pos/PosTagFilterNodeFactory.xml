    <name>POS Filter</name>
    <shortDescription>Filters terms with POS tags not specified as valid.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	Filters all terms contained in the given bag of words (input table) 
        	that have POS tags assigned which are not specified as valid. The
        	terms are filtered out of the bag of words and the documents as well 
        	if deep preprocessing is checked.<br />
        	A term is kept if at least one of its assigned POS tags is a valid 
        	tag. If strict filtering is set, all assigned POS tags of a term 
        	have to be valid.

        <option name="Strict filtering">
             If strict filtering is checked, all tags (of a certain type) of the
             term have to be valid. If setting is not checked, at least
             one tag has to be valid.
        </option>
        <option name="Tags">
             The tags to use as valid tags.
        </option>
        
        <option name="Document column">
              Specifies the column containing the documents to preprocess.
        </option>
        <option name="Deep preprocessing">
             If deep preprocessing is checked, the terms contained inside
             the documents are converted too, this means that the documents are
             changed, which is more time consuming. 
        </option>
        <option name="Append original document">
            If append original document is checked, the documents contained in
            the input document column are appended as extra column. This
            enables later on a mapping of preprocessed documents to original
            documents.
