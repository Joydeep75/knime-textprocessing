        <intro>
        	Filters all terms contained in the specified stop word file.

        <option name="Use build in list">
              Specifies if build in stop word list is used or not. If checked
              the specified path will be ignored.

        <option name="Stopword lists">
              Available build in stop word lists. If "Use build in list" is
              checked, the build in stop word list to use can be specified here.

        <option name="Selected file">
              The location of the stop word file. Stop words need to be written

        <option name="Deep preprocessing">
             If deep preprocessing is checked, the terms contained inside
             the documents are preprocessed too, this means that the documents
             themselves are changed too, which is more time consuming.
        </option>
        <option name="Document column">
              Specifies the column containing the documents to preprocess.
        </option>
        <option name="Append unchanged documents">
            If checked, the documents contained in the specified "Original
            Document column" are appended unchanged even if deep preprocessing
            is checked. This helps to keep the original documents in the
            output data table without the agonizing pain of joining.
        </option>
        <option name="Original Document column">
              Specifies the column containing the original documents which
              can be attached unchanged.
