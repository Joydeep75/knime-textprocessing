        <intro>
        	This node allows you to filter punctuation symbols out of terms
        	of the given bag of words. The preprocessed terms are stored in the
        	outgoing DataTable, as well as the documents containing these terms.
		</intro>
        <option name="Deep preprocessing">
             If deep preprocessing is checked, the terms contained inside
             the documents are preprocessed too, this means that the documents are
             changed, which is more time consuming.
