    <name>Punctuation Erasure</name>
    <shortDescription>Erases the punctuation characters of terms.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	This node allows you to erase punctuation characters of terms.
        	The preprocessed terms are stored in the outgoing DataTable, 
        	as well as the documents containing these terms.
		</intro>
		
        <option name="Deep preprocessing">
             If deep preprocessing is checked, the terms contained inside
             the documents are preprocessed too, this means that the documents 
             themselves are changed too, which is more time consuming. 
        </option>        
        <option name="Document column">
              Specifies the column containing the documents to preprocess.
        </option>
        <option name="Append unchanged documents">
            If checked, the documents contained in the specified "Original 
            Document column" are appended unchanged even if deep preprocessing
            is checked. This helps to keep the original documents in the
            output data table without the agonizing pain of joining.
        </option>
        <option name="Original Document column">
              Specifies the column containing the original documents which
              can be attached unchanged.
        </option>        
        <option name="Ignore unmodifiable tag">
              If checked unmodifiable terms will be preprocessed too.
        </option>
