    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	This node allows you to filter punctuation symbols out of terms
        	of the given bag of words. The preprocessed terms are stored in the
        	outgoing DataTable, as well as the documents containing these terms.

        <option name="Document column">
              Specifies the column containing the documents to preprocess.
        </option>
        <option name="Deep preprocessing">
             If deep preprocessing is checked, the terms contained inside
             the documents are converted too, this means that the documents are
             changed, which is more time consuming. 
        </option>
        <option name="Append original document">
            If append original document is checked, the documents contained in
            the input document column are appended as extra column. This
            enables later on a mapping of preprocessed documents to original
            documents.
