	<shortDescription>
	   Filters terms with a specified frequency value.

	<fullDescription>
	<intro>
        Filters terms in the given bag of words (input data table) and if
        specified in the documents as well, with a certain frequency value.
        On the one hand minimum and maximum values can be defined to be
        used for filtering. If the value of a specified frequency column
        is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum value the term is
        filtered. On the other hand a number k of terms to keep can be defined. 
        Only those k terms with the highest frequency value are kept, the rest 
        is filtered.

        <option name="Deep filtering">
             If deep filtering is checked, the terms contained inside
             the documents are filtered too, this means that the documents are
             changed, which is more time consuming.
