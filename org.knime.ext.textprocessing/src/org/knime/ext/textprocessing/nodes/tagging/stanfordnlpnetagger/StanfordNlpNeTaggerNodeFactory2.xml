    <name>StanfordNLP NE Tagger</name>
    <shortDescription>Assigns named entity tags to terms. 
        Suitable for English, German and Spanish texts.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            <p>
            This node assigns a named entity tag to each term of a document.
			It is applicable for English, German and Spanish texts. The 
            built-in tagger models are models created by the Stanford NLP group:<br/>
            <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/">http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/</a>.<br/>
            You can use the StanfordNLP NE Learner to create your own model based on untagged documents and a dictionary
            and forward the model to the second input port of this node.
            If there is no input model, the "use model from input port" option will be deactivated.
            The other way around, if there is a model at the input port and the optionis activated, the StanfordNLP
            model selection will be disabled. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>Note:</b> The provided tagger models vary in memory consumption and processing speed. 
            Especially the distsim models have an increased runtime,
            but mostly a better performance as well. There are also models without distributional similarity features.
            For the usage of these models it is recommended to run KNIME with at least 2GB of heap space. 
            To increase the head space, change the -Xmx setting in the knime.ini file.

        <option name="Document column">
            The column containing the documents to tag.
        </option>
        <option name="Replace documents">
            If checked, the documents will be replaced by the new tagged documents. Otherwise the tagged
            documents will be appended as new column. 
        </option>
        <option name="Append column">
            The name of the new appended column, containing the tagged documents.            
        </option>
        <option name="Word tokenizer">
            Select the tokenizer used for word tokenization. Go to <i>Preferences -> KNIME -> Textprocessing</i>
            to read the description for each tokenizer.
        </option>
		<option name="Number of maximal parallel tagging processes">
            Defines the maximal number of parallel threads that are used for tagging. Please note, that for each thread
            a tagging model will be loaded into memory. If this value is set to a number greater than 1, make sure that
            enough heap space is available, in order to be able to load the models. If you are not sure how much heap is 
            available for KNIME, leave the number to 1.

        <option name="Use model from input port">
            If checked, the model from second input port will be included.

            If checked, consecutive words with the same tag will be combined.
