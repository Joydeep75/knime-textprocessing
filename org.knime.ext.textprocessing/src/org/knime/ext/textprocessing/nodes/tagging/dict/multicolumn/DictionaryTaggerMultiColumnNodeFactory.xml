    <name>Dictionary Tagger (Multi Column)</name>
    <shortDescription>Assigns specified tags values of specified tag types 
        to terms specified in a dictionary column.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	<p>
            This node recognizes named entities specified in one or more dictionary columns 
            and assigns a specified tag value and type. Optionally, the 
            recognized named entity terms can be set unmodifiable, meaning that 
            the terms are not modified or filtered afterwards by any following preprocessing
            node. However, succeeding tagging nodes can overwrite tags of an unmodifiable term.
            </p>
            <p>
            If the same entity is contained in different dictionaries, it will be tagged for every fitting configuration.
            For example, the document contains the term "London" and "London" is also contained in three different
            dictionaries, it will be tagged with all three tags that have been set for the specific dictionaries.
            </p>
            <p>
            The sequence of the tags depends on the order of the dictionaries within the node dialog. 
            The order can be changed by using the up/down arrow buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
            Note, if there are any multi word entities in your dictionary and there is a succeeding dictionary
            containing one word of the multi word entity, the single word will be tagged only.
            </p>
            <p>
            Example:
            </p>
 			<ul>
  			<li>Document: "New York is beautiful."</li>
 			<li>Dictionary 1: "New York"</li>
  			<li>Dictionary 2: "York"</li>
			</ul> 
			<p>
			In this case only "York" will be tagged. If there is a third dictionary containing "New York" as well,
            "New York" will be tagged with the tags set for the first and the third dictionary. <br/>
			The order of the entities within a dictionary is also important. 
            Equally as the order of the dictionaries, the first entity in the dictionary will be tagged first.

        <option name="Replace documents">
            If checked, the documents will be replaced by the new tagged documents. Otherwise the tagged
            documents will be appended as new column.

        <option name="Word tokenizer">
            Select the tokenizer used for word tokenization. Go to <i>Preferences -> KNIME -> Textprocessing</i>

		<option name="Number of maximal parallel tagging processes">
            Defines the maximal number of parallel threads that are used for tagging. Please note, that for each thread
            a tagging model will be loaded into memory. If this value is set to a number greater than 1, make sure that
            enough heap space is available, in order to be able to load the models. If you are not sure how much heap is 
            available for KNIME, leave the number to 1.
