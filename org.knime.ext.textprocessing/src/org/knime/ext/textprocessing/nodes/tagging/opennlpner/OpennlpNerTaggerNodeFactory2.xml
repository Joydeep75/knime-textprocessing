    <name>OpenNLP NE Tagger</name>
    <shortDescription>Assigs named entity tags, such as "PERSON" or "LOCATION".
    </shortDescription> 
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node recognizes named entities based on <i>OpenNLP Name Finder</i> models and assigns the corresponding tags to them. 
            The version of the underlying OpenNLP framework is 1.8.4. The built-in models are pre-trained models from OpenNLP version 1.5.<br/>
            It is also possible to tag documents with other models than the built-in models.
            To do so, the model has to be read with the <i>OpenNLP NER Model Reader</i> node.<br/>
            <i>Note:</i> Models trained with OpenNLP versions lower than 1.5 or higher than 1.8.4 might not work correctly.<br/>
            The following entities are recognized: Persons, Locations, Organizations, Money, 
            Date, and Time.<br/>
            For more details of the OpenNLP natural language processing toolkit, click <a href="http://opennlp.apache.org/docs/">here</a>.

        <tab name="General options">
        <option name="Document column">
            The column containing the documents to tag.
        </option>
        <option name="Replace column">
            If checked, the documents of the selected document column will be replaced by the new tagged documents.
            Otherwise the tagged documents will be appended as new column. 
        </option>
        <option name="Append column">
            The name of the new appended column, containing the tagged documents.            
        </option>
        <option name="Word tokenizer">
            Select the tokenizer used for word tokenization. Go to <i>Preferences -> KNIME -> Textprocessing</i>
            to read the description for each tokenizer.
        </option>
		<option name="Number of maximal parallel tagging processes">
            Defines the maximal number of parallel threads that are used for tagging. Please note, that for each thread
            a tagging model will be loaded into memory. If this value is set to a number greater than 1, make sure that
            enough heap space is available, in order to be able to load the models. If you are not sure how much heap is 
            available for KNIME, leave the number to 1.

        <tab name="Tagger options">
        <option name="Set named entities unmodifiable">
            Sets recognized named entity terms unmodifiable.
        </option>
        <option name="Built-in OpenNLP model">
            Specifies the OpenNLP model to use. Each model is able to recognize
            a certain type of named entities.
        </option>
		<option name="Use model from input port">
            If checked, the model from the second input port will be used for tagging.
        </option>
       	<option name="Tag value">
            Specifies the named-entity tag to be used for tagging with the model from the input port.
