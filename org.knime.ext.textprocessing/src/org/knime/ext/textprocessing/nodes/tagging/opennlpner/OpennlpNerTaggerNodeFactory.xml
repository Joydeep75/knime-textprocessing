        <intro>
            This node recognizes named enities based on opennlp models version 
            1.5.2 and assigns the corresponding tags to them. The following 
            entities are recognized: Persons, Locations, Organizations, Money, 
            Date, and Time. For more details of the OpenNlp natural language 
            processing toolkit, see 
            http://opennlp.apache.org/documentation.html.

        <option name="Set named entities unmodifiable">

        </option>
        <option name="OpenNlp model">
            Specifies the OpenNLP model to use. Each model is able to recognize
            a certain type of named entities.
        </option>
        <option name="Use additional dictionary file">
            If checked an additional dictionary file is used by the OpenNlp
            model to recognize entities.
        </option>
        <option name="Dictionary file">
            The location of the dictionary file. Each named entity have to be 
            written in one line and each word of this entity must be separated 
            by a whitespace, i.e:<br />
            Firstname1 Lastname2<br />
            Firstname2 Lastname2

        <tab name="Concurrency">
        <option name="Number of maximal parallel tagging processes">
            Defines the maximal number of parallel threads that are used for tagging. Please note, that for each thread
            a tagging model will be loaded into memory. If this value is set to a number greater than 1, make sure that
            enough heap space is available, in order to be able to load the models. If you are not sure how much heap is 
            available for KNIME, leave the number to 1.
