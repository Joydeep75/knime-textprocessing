    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Assigns chemical named entity tags to terms which are recognized
            by the OSCAR chemical named entity recognizer framework version 4.1.2
            (see https://bitbucket.org/wwmm/oscar4/overview for details).
            As tags the default named entity types of the OSCAR framework
            are used (see http://apidoc.ch.cam.ac.uk/oscar4-4.0.1/).
            The OSCAR tag filter is afterwards able to filter the 
            assigned tags.

        <option name="Number of maximal parallel tagging processes">
            Defines the maximal number of parallel threads that are used for tagging. Please note, that for each thread
            a tagging model will be loaded into memory. If this value is set to a number greater than 1, make sure that
            enough heap space is available, in order to be able to load the models. If you are not sure how much heap is 
            available for KNIME, leave the number to 1.
