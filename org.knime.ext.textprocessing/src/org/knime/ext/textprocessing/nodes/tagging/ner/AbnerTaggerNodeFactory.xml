        <intro>
            This node recognizes biomedical named entities, such as genes, 
            proteins or cells and assigns tags to the corresponding terms like 
            "GENE", "PROTEIN", "CELL LINE" or "CELL TYPE". Furthermore it can be
            specified that found named entities are marked as unmodifiable,
            meaning that they are not modified by any node afterwards.
            As underlying named entity recognition software ABNER 
            (A Biomedical named entity recognizer) was used. For more details
            see: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bsettles/abner/.
