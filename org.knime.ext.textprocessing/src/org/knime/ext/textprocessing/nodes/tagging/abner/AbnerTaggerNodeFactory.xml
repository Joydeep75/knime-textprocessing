    <shortDescription>Assigns biomedical named entity tags to terms.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node recognizes biomedical named entities, such as genes, 
            proteins or cells and assigns tags to the corresponding terms like 
            "PROTEIN", "RNA", "DNA", "CELL LINE" or "CELL TYPE". Furthermore 
            it can be specified that found named entities are marked as 
            unmodifiable, meaning that they are not going to be modified by any 
            node afterwards. As underlying named entity recognition software 
            ABNER (A Biomedical named entity recognizer) was used. For more 
            details see: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bsettles/abner/.

        <option name="Set named entities unmodifiable">
            Sets recognized named entity terms unmodifiable.
        </option>
        <option name="ABNER model">
            Specifies the ABNER model to use. The <i>Biocreative</i> model 
            recognizes proteins only, the <i>NLPBA</i> model 
            recognizes cells, dna and rna lines as well.
        </option>
        <option name="Word tokenizer">
            Select the tokenizer used for word tokenization. Go to <i>Preferences -> KNIME -> Textprocessing</i>
            to read the description for each tokenizer.
