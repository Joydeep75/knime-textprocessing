    <name>STTS Filter</name>
    <shortDescription>Filters terms with certain STTS tags.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	Filters all terms that don't have the specified STTS tags assigned.
        	The terms are filtered out of the bag of words and the documents as well
        	if deep preprocessing is checked.<br />
        	A term is kept if at least one of the specified STTS tags is assigned.
        	If strict filtering is set, all specified STTS tags have to be
        	assigned to a term.
		</intro>

		<tab name="Preprocessing options">
        <option name="Strict filtering">
             If strict filtering is checked, all specified STTS tags have to be applied
             to the terms. Otherwise at least one of the specified tags has to be
             applied to the terms.
        </option>
        <option name="Filter matching">
             If checked, terms which have the specified tags are filtered,
             otherwise they are kept. If strict filtering is checked, all tags
             must match to filter or keep a term.
        </option>
        <option name="Tags">
             The tags to filter for.

        <tab name="Deep preprocessing options">
        <option name="Deep preprocessing">
             If deep preprocessing is checked, the terms contained inside
             the documents are preprocessed too, this means that the documents
             themselves are changed too, which is more time consuming.
        </option>
        <option name="Document column">
              Specifies the column containing the documents to preprocess.
        </option>
        <option name="Append unchanged documents">
            If checked, the documents contained in the specified "Original
            Document column" are appended unchanged even if deep preprocessing
            is checked. This helps to keep the original documents in the
            output data table without the agonizing pain of joining.
        </option>
        <option name="Original Document column">
              Specifies the column containing the original documents which
              can be attached unchanged.
        </option>
        <option name="Ignore unmodifiable tag">
              If checked unmodifiable terms will be preprocessed too.
